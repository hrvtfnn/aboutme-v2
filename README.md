# About-me Page 🥰
I created a one-page virtual business card for a school project. <br>
As a graphic designer, I used my brand colors for the site to make it more suitable. In the future, I plan to create a website to showcase my portfolio and CV.

# What I learned 🪄
Although I faced some challenges with the floating situation, it was my first project that I had to work on alone, so I am proud of it. 🎉

# To Do List for the future ✏️
